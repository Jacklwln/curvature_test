This figure shows the mean curvature,gauss curvature 
and maximum curvature's groundtruth of torus in 1st row and the discrete 
computing value in 2nd row. 

This is junior graduate student training based on the paper Discrete Differential-Geometry Operators 
for Triangulated 2-Manifolds, knowing the cotangent form curvature operator 
and practice of halfedge structure, mesh curvature measure and mesh smoothing
based on the mean curvature flow.
