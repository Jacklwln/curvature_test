# curvature_test
The corresponding figure in gallery shows the mean curvature,gauss curvature 
and maximum curvature's groundtruth of torus in 1st line and the discrete 
computing value in 2nd line. 

Junior training based on the paper Discrete Differential-Geometry Operators 
for Triangulated 2-Manifolds, knowing the cotangent form curvature operator 
and practice of halfedge structure, mesh curvature mea- sure and mesh smoothing
based on the mean curvature flow.
